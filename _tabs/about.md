ðŸ‘‹ Hey there. I'm Troy. I'm a systems administrator who's passionate about all-things technology and information security. I've been in IT since 2016 and have managed infrastrucutre from the systems, network, and security side. I mostly deal with Active Directory, VMware, PowerShell, Group Policy, Office365, SCCM, SIEM management, and implementing security controls while doing a bit of analyst-type work. I enjoy practicing offensive and defensive methodologies in lab environments and aim at applying those to my professional career to make myself a more well-rounded indivdual.  

I started this blog to share knowledge about the technologies I work with and some of the methdologies I've acquired while studying cybersecurity. Although, I don't expect this to stay <i>just</i> a blog regarding infosec. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or Github!


## How I got started
I attended college to initially study criminal justice; that only lasted one year. I then switched to Computer Networking, and that's where I began my interest in IT. Prior to that, I was a nerd who loved video games (World of Warcraft, anyone?) and had fun building and messing around with computers at the time. I developed a quick interest with networking from a routing and switching perspective after having taken a few courses that were focused around Cisco CLI. I achieved my first certification - CCENT (Cisco Certified Entry Level Networking Technician) while in college and knew at that point I would involve myself in IT. 

From there, I started my first job in IT as a support technician for a small municipal government. I mentored to become a jr. sysadmin and then moved on to higher education where I currently reside today as a sysadmin. During this time I became fascinated with ethical hacking and watched Heath Adams' "The Cyber Mentor" 0 to Hero Penetration Testing course on YouTube. I highly recommend others to take a look at TCM Academy, which started from Heath's Youtube series. He's a phenomenal educator and is a reason I have the interest in infosec today. 

Over this time, I developed a strong sense of continuous learning. I am <i>always</i> learning. Whether that's for career development, or learning how to fix something on my bike, it's a part of what drives me to be a better person. I pride myself in the discipline I have to learn new technologies. I've since acquired my CCNA, Security+, CYSA+, and eJPT certifications and enjoy the challenge of planning, studying, and testing myself of the topics  I learn. 


## Everyday Life
At my core, I'm a thrill seeker and a tinkerer. I love the outdoors and enjoy taking the time to understand how things tick. I'm passionate about riding motorcycles, snowboarding on the east (<i>ice</i>) coast, and enjoy playing the guitar or video games in my free time. 

I'm also a big advocate for Bitcoin adoption and it's protocol development. In ways that I can, I would like to contribute towards it's development. I run a Bitcoin full node and Lightning node and encourage others to do that same. 

â‚¿, Troy
