# Welcome
Hello and welcome to my homelab documentation site!

I've been wanting to start this site to host knowledge, documentation, and proof of concept surrounding cybersecurity, server administration, PowerShell, and well... I guess anything, really. 

<br>

## How its hosted...
I'm hosting this using Github Pages with help of a static site generator; in this case, Jekyll. 

I also chose to use a theme called Chirpy since, well, it looks great. Support for dark mode? Let's go. 

<br>

## Content to be published...
* Labs related to offensive/defensive security
* Server administration stuff
* Active Directory stuff
* PowerShell scripts
* Food recipes? 

<br>

## A quick note about code blocks...
```
```

Javascript
```javascript
console.log('hello world!');
```

Yaml
```yml
name: 'push-remote'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths-iignore:
      - .gitignore
      - .README.md
      - LICENSE
```

Bash
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's to hoping I continue with this journey.
